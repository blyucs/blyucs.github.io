#### A Novel Framework for Detecting Social Bots with Deep Neural Networks and Active Learning

Data collection 

1. The motivation for this article is meaningful and technically sound. But before the acception, I suggested much more work should be done or revision:
   1. The description of the process of the Sina Weibo's data collection approach, such as detection bypassing, proxy, etc. can weaken, for it has nothing to do with the scientific research and experimental demonstration.
   2. F-score would be more accurate if it is described as F1-score.
   3. In the model, the ablation effect of BiGRU Block, Resnet Block, and the Attention layer is suggested to be conducted.
   4. It is suggested to quote some recent research progress related to deep learning, such as:
      [1] Structural property-aware multilayer network embedding for latent factor analysis, Pattern Recognition, vol. 76, pp. 228-241, 2018. 
      [2] Multi-label image classification via feature/label co-projection, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems, DOI: 10.1109/TSMC.2020.2967071
   5. Most of the current comparative experiments are traditional machine learning methods. Are there any comparisons between deep learning or reinforcement learning methods from other papers? (As described in the relevant work, DQL) 




The motivation for this article is meaningful and technically sound. The ideas are innovative. The experimental ideas in this article are clear and the writing is methodical. But before the acception, I suggested much more work should be done or revision, as the evaluation submitted to the author.

Dear author:
   This article provides a new way of thinking in the field of financial analysis, which is instructive for readers and future research work, but i believe there exist some problems in terms of the writing and experiment:
    1. For the professional reader of the journals e.g. KBS,  so much contents with respect to the basic instrctuion of CNN is not proper. 
        2. Besides, I can't found the comparsion methods are random walk and ARMA model, which are foundamental models. 
        3. No ablation study is presented, how about the VMD combined with other regression models, or provide the sufficient reason and theoretical analysis to choose the VMD.
